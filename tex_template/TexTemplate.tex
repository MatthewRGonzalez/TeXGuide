% This section ^^ is called a preample. Sometimes you need a ton of packages. Some Authors use like 400. Which is too stressful so I'm not including them.

\section{Introduction}
The following document provides a LaTeX template along with some comments/descriptions in the actual ``.tex'' Document
 
% Note that quotes need to be entered as follows: ``LaTeX is dumb'' as opposed to "LaTeX is dumb"
 
\subsection{Notes}
Here we use a subsection. \footnote{This is a footnote}



\section{Equations}

Here's an equation:

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=1}^N 2x +4 
\end{equation}

Here's an inline equation $2+2=\beta$


\section{Bullets}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Bullet points are fun}
	\item{\href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/} {stackX}}
	\item{\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Hyperlinks}{overleaf}}
\end{itemize}


\clearpage
% note that \newpage is also sufficient. 



\section{Tables} 

The next section shows basic table stuff. Use Stargazer and copy/paste. Or use Stata. Sometimes use a \href{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/}{table generator}: They get tricky and annoying
